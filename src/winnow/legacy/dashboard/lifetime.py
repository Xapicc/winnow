"""Lifetime savings ledger — surfaces cozempic's running totals on the dashboard.

The dashboard's per-prune views (D2) only see receipts, which are new. cozempic
has ALSO kept a lifetime counter at ``~/.cozempic_savings.json`` since long before
receipts existed (see helpers.record_savings). This loader reads that ledger so the
dashboard can lead with the user's TRUE totals (e.g. 456M tokens across 3,309
prunes) instead of just the handful of receipts recorded so far.

Pure-ish: ``load_lifetime`` does tolerant I/O and returns a normalized dict (or
None). It never raises.

"""Receipt persistence — D1 of the dashboard build path.

Writes ``PruneReceipt`` records (see :mod:`cozempic.metrics`) to a LOCAL,
append-only log the dashboard reads. Never network — this is local provenance,
distinct from any telemetry, and honors a dedicated opt-out.

Hard invariant: **a receipt must never break or defer a prune.** Every public
function here is exception-isolated and returns ``None`` on any failure rather
than propagating — losing a receipt is acceptable; corrupting a prune is not.

Layout under ``~/.cozempic/receipts/``:
  * ``<session_id_hash>.jsonl`` — full receipts for one session, one per line.
  * ``index.jsonl``            — compact per-prune summaries for fast dashboard load.

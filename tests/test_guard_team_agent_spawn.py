"""F1 fix — RED→GREEN regression guards for Agent-spawned team visibility.

Each test that is a genuine regression guard is PROVEN RED at base 4f15d6d before
any fix is applied; characterization / invariant-preservation tests that pass at
base are clearly labelled as such in their docstrings.

Test classes:
  TestTeamNameExtraction           — P0-A: team_name key mismatch
  TestAgentSpawnRecognition        — P0-B: Agent tool recognition in extract_team_state
  TestSendMessageByNameLookup      — P0-C: by-name SendMessage resolution
  TestIdleNotificationTransition   — P0-D: idle_notification terminal transition
  TestStatusBasedSafetyInvariant   — documents status-only invariant (P0-E gate removed)
  TestFullScenario                 — integration: pure-SendMessage team, no shared tasks
  TestStaleConfigAntiWedge         — C-1: stale config can't inject "running" status
  TestIdleNotificationPruneProtection — C-2: idle carrier prune protection
  TestFailedAgentSpawnNoWedge      — H-1: failed spawn placeholder cleanup
  TestGateRemoval                  — C-1 gate-removal regression guards
  TestNestedTeammateMessageRegex   — M-1: nested teammate-message regex tightening

Isolation:
  All tests go through _extract() which patches load_team_configs to return []
  (no live ~/.claude/teams/ config merge contamination — L11 isolation principle).
  No real 'cozempic guard --daemon', no os.kill on real PIDs.

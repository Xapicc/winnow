"""Guard-loop watchdog — a process safeguard against futile reload-loops.

History: a guard daemon reload-looped 202x on an UNPRUNABLE over-threshold session
(f641174c, 2026-06-10) and again in the PilotCC incident (deferred-writer failure).
Each was a CODE bug fixed in-process (1.8.29, 1.8.19). But code fixes only protect
daemons running the new code — an OLD daemon (e.g. a brew-1.8.22 install still
resident) keeps looping until killed by hand. And the QA process reviews a DIFF,
not the SYSTEM running over time, so an emergent loop is invisible to it.

This watchdog closes that gap from the OUTSIDE: it reads the guard log files the
daemons already write and flags any that show the full-speed futile-loop signature
— many near-0% prunes with NO escalating back-off and NO circuit-breaker exit. The
trip threshold sits well ABOVE the in-process K-exit (10), so a CORRECTLY behaving
1.8.29+ guard (which K-exits or backs off to the 300s cap then exits) never trips
it; only a daemon that fails to self-arrest does.

Pure detection lives in ``scan_log_text`` (fully unit-testable on captured/synthetic
log text). ``scan_guard_logs`` adds filesystem + pid-liveness. The CLI reports by
default and only terminates a confirmed-looping daemon under an explicit ``--fix``.

# rewritten" lines (NOT "Pruned: …" lines), so it never accrues futile prune
# cycles at all. Reaching >= 20 means EITHER a single daemon that failed to
# self-arrest OR — the REAL f641174c shape — a RESPAWN STORM: the SessionStart
# hook respawning a fresh guard onto a permanently-unprunable session over and

# commas) as a harmless superset. WITHOUT this, every productive prune line is
# unparsed, so the futile-dominance ratio skews to ~1.0 and the watchdog
# FALSE-FLAGS a healthy daemon as looping (and --fix would SIGTERM it). The count
# is matched but NOT captured (the percent is the only capture group, group 1, and
# the only value consumed downstream), so the K/M/comma suffix only needs tolerating.
# Anchored to line-start (re.M, optional leading whitespace) — the guard emits its

    #    the prior attempt false-flagged this — R15 FP).
    #  - HEALTHY fresh gen + a couple of STALE escalations from dead gens (~10 errors):
